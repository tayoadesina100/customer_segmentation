# customer_segmentation
**Customer Segmentation Analysis Repository**

This repository contains the code and documentation for a customer segmentation analysis using KMeans clustering, Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). The main goal of this analysis is to gain insights into customer behavior.

### Files Included:

1. **README.md**: This file provides an overview of the repository and instructions on how to navigate through the code and documentation.

2. **customer_segmentation_analysis.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing the main analysis code. It includes steps for data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, PCA, KMeans clustering, and visualization of results.

3. **data/**: Folder containing the dataset used for analysis. 

### Usage:

To replicate the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:
   ```
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```
   
2. Open the `customer_segmentation_analysis.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter Notebook or any compatible environment.

3. Ensure all necessary libraries are installed. You may use `pip` or `conda` to install dependencies listed in the notebook.

4. Run each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, PCA, and KMeans clustering.

5. Review the insights obtained from the analysis and interpret the results.

### Dataset:

The dataset used for this analysis is located in the `data/` folder. It includes relevant information about customers that will be used for segmentation.

### Analysis Steps:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: 
   - Handle missing values, if any.
   - Encode categorical variables.
   - Scale the data as required.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Understand the distribution of variables.
   - Identify correlations between variables.
   - Visualize trends and patterns in the data.

3. **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**:
   - Reduce the dimensionality of the data using PCA.
   - Identify the principal components explaining the most variance in the data.

4. **KMeans Clustering**:
   - Determine the optimal number of clusters using techniques such as the elbow method or silhouette score.
   - Perform KMeans clustering on the principal components.

5. **Visualization**:
   - Visualize the results of clustering to understand customer segments.

### Results:

- The analysis provides insights into different customer segments based on their behavior and characteristics.
- The identified segments can be used for targeted marketing strategies, product recommendations, or personalized customer experiences.
